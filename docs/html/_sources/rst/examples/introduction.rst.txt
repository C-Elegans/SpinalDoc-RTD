Examples are split in tree kinds:


* Simple ones that could be used to get used to the basics of SpinalHDL.
* Intermediates ones which implement components by using a traditional approach.
* Advanced ones which go further than traditional HDL by using object oriented programming, functional programming, and meta-hardware description.

They are all accessible in the sidebar under the corresponding sections.
